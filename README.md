Financial Analysis - Expenses, Revenue and EBIT Project

Financial Analysis - Revenue

I used a Dataset for an Isreali water desalination company that sells fresh water for
three customer segments: Residential, Public, and Private. Within these customer
segments, both Hard and Soft water products are sold. They were three
desalination plants, Kootha, Surjek and Jutik. The goal of this project was to
Analyze the revenue of each of the three desalination units and look for trends in
the Dataset.

Steps:
1. I used the Data Repository Table to get the values for Q1 to Q3 on the
Revenue Analysis tab. To get the values, I extracted the values by filtering
the data in the Data Repository Table and adding the corresponding values to
the correct month and Profit Centre/Element.

2. After getting the correct values, I used it to create different plots to
demonstrate how the different units varied from each other. I also answered
questions about the trend of the dataset.

Excel document in my GitHub repository. Focus on the Revenue Analysis and Data
Repository Tabs.


Financial Analysis – Expenses

Steps:
1. I used the Data Repository Table to get the values for Q4 to Q7 on the
Expenses Analysis tab. To get the values, I extracted the values by filtering
the data in the Data Repository Table and adding the corresponding values to
the correct month and Cost Centre/Element.

2. After getting the correct values, I used it to create different plots to
demonstrate how the different units varied from each other. I also answered
questions about the trend of the dataset.

Financial Analysis – EBIT

I used a Dataset for an Isreali water desalination company that sells fresh water for
three customer segments: Residential, Public, and Private. Within these customer
segments, both Hard and Soft water products are sold. They were three
desalination plants, Kootha, Surjek and Jutik. The goal of this project was to
Analyze the Revenue and Expenses of each of the three desalination units and look
for trends in the Dataset and calculate the EBIT (Revenue – Expenses).

Steps:
1. I used the Data Repository Table to get the values for Q8 on the EBIT tab.
To get the values, I extracted the values by filtering the data in the Data
Repository Table and adding the corresponding values to the correct month
and Cost Centre/Element.

2. After getting the correct values, I used it to create different plots to
demonstrate how the different units varied from each other. I also answered
questions about the trend of the dataset.
